Depends: literal-data, signatures

This module defines two additional signature type values:

0x00 Binary data, the signer certifies that the signed binary data has not been modified.
0x01 Text data, the signer certifies that the signed text data has not been modified, except to normalize line-endings.  The signature is made over the text with line-endings normalised to <CR><LF>.

== Message Format ==

An OpenPGP message comprised of only two packets, first a signature packet, then a literal data packet, represents a signature by the given signature over the octets of the literal data stored in the literal data packet.  The other metadata in the literal data packet is not signed.

Some implementations may allow multiple signature packets to precede the literal data packet, in order to represent multiple signatures of the same data.

== Detached Signatures ==

One or more signature packets may be stored or transmitted in a file by themselves, with the data that was signed over stored or transmitted seperately in an implementation-specific way.
