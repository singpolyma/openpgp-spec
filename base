This module specifies base practises needed for use of OpenPGP in any application.

== Numbers ==

Numbers are always unsigned and encoded in network byte-order (that is, big-endian).

== Multiprecision Integers ==

MPIs are use to hold large, variable-sized, unsigned integers.

They consist of a 2-octet number representing their length in bits, followed by the network byte-order octets of the integer.

The number of octets in the body is ((length field + 7) / 8) + 2.

The length field describes the length starting from the most significant non-zero bit.

== Text ==

Text is always encoded using UTF-8.

== Times ==

Times are encoded using a 4-octet number representing the number of seconds since 1970-01-01T00:00:00Z.

== Packets ==

OpenPGP messages are comprised of a series of packets.  Various modules will specify specific packets.  Every packet has a header in the same format.

The first octet contains the packet "tag", which specifies the format of the packet.  The first and second bit of this octet must always be set (tag | 0xC0).  The rest of the bits specify the the "tag" (first-octet & 0x3F).

The second octet is always 0xFF, followed by a four-octet number encoding the length of the packet in bytes.  This limits packet length to just over 4 TB.  If this limitation proves to be a problem in practise, this specification may be extended to allow packet lengths to be specified in another way.

Unsupported tag values MUST NOT cause an error in parsing, but such packets MAY be discarded as unsupported.

Tag values 60, 61, 62, and 63 are reserved for specifying private or experimental packets.

Tag value 12 is reserved for specifying key trust information, but the format of this information is implementation-specific.
